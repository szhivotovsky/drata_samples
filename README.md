NOT production code! 

Sample snippets built to demo the following usecases:

1. getUsers.js --> Make GET call to Okta to retrieve user data and save it to file
2. postEvidenceUp.mjs --> Uploads file to Drata Evidence Library and maps to controls
3. postDrata --> Creates URL record in Drata Evidence Library and maps to controls
